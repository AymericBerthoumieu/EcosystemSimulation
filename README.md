## Miscellaneous

This repository contains a directory *templates* which contains some code templates to get a common base for the coding styles adopted while developing this project.
It is highly recommended to have a look at these files before coding here.

## Lauching tests
In order to test the different features developped, you first need to compile the relevant files using the following command line :
`make -f [theCorrectMakeFile].mk`
Then, you just have to run the executable created by the makefile (that shoulf have the same name ad the corresponding makefile).
